## How efficient learning works

1. I explain and show
2. We do together
3. You do and I help

**Tip:** this repository has everything to work through the test exercises.

[bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics)

🎉 If you can fill all "cypress/integration/.../spec.js" tests, you know Cypress. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Requirements

You will need:

- `git` to clone this repo
- Node v14+ to install dependencies

```text
git clone <repo url>
cd cypress-workshop-basics
npm install
```

---

## Repo organization

- `/todomvc` is a web application we are going to test
- all tests are in `cypress/integration` folder
  - there are subfolders for exercises
    - `01-basic`
    - `02-adding-items`
    - `03-selector-playground`
    - `04-reset-state`
    - etc
- keep application `todomvc` running!

Note:
We are going to keep the app running, while switching from spec to spec for each part.

+++

## `todomvc`

Let us look at the application.

- `cd todomvc`
- `npm start`
- `open localhost:3000`

**important** keep application running through the entire workshop!

+++

It is a regular TodoMVC application.

If you have Vue DevTools plugin

![With Vue DevTools](./img/vue-devtools.png)

+++

Look at XHR when using the app

![Network](./img/network.png)

+++

Look at `todomvc/index.html` - main app DOM structure

![DOM](./img/DOM.png)

+++

Look at `todomvc/app.js`

## Questions

- what happens when you add a new Todo item? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- how does it get to the server? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- where does the server save it? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- what happens on start up? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
The students should open DevTools and look at XHR requests that go between the web application and the server. Also the students should find `todomvc/data.json` file with saved items.
